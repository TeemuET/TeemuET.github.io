## Intro
During the summer of 2025 I got the opportunity to work for the Probabilistic Machine Learning Group (Aalto Department of Computer Science) under the supervision of Samuel Kaski and Marshal Sinaga. My internship aimed at finding and identifying promising avenues in improving robustness of Bayesian Optimization (BO). 

BO is an optimization method... brief description of BO

During the internship I covered a large amount of literature which included topics such as calibration and conformal prediction in the context of BO.

## Objective
After identifying stuff.... about literature. We settled for the following research questions.

## Results roughly
